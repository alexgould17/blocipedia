# Welcome to blocipedia!
blocipedia is a create-your-own Wiki app that I created using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript while completing the Web Developer Track at bloc.io. You can sign up, sign in & sign out; and create, view, edit & delete wikis, with the proper permissions, of course. Test/dev db's are Sqlite3, production db is PostgreSQL. Bootstrap was used for the styling, Devise for user functionality, and Faker for the pre-seeded data.

## To Use The App
- Go to https://ag17-blocipedia.herokuapp.com/
- Sign in using the email admin@test.test & password wsxedc
- Have fun & poke around! Try creating your own wiki or contributing to an existing one by editing it!
